<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">Snap Inc., San Francisco | Software Engineer</h2>

June 2022 - Now

Returned to the Data Mesh Catalog (DMC) team improve data searchability at Snap.
This meant making it easier to find and reuse useful data stored in different
media (e.g. BigQuery tables, GCS buckets, Looker dashboards, etc.). I am
responsible for:

- Using React and Typescript to maintain an SPA that allows users to search for
  data to see how often it’s being used and where.
- Developing the Java backend for the above service to provide data from
  BigQuery, Spanner, and Hbase datastores (primarily querying using SQL).
- Creating pipelines to catalog metadata, primarily using Apache Airflow,
  BigQuery, and Spanner.
- Maintaining and monitoring our services using Grafana, Kubernetes, Docker,
  Jenkins, and other tools.
- Providing excellent and timely customer support.
- Onboarding new hires to the project.

Our team is also spearheading the effort to make BigQuery a tier 1 service at
Snap. This means that we:

- Save millions of dollars per year by identifying unused resources for
  deletion.
- Monitor query cost and performance with Grafana dashboards to maintain a high
  quality of service.
